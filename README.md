# Discord Lonely Bot
Personal discord bot

To Do List:
1. Make it annoy James
2. Back me up on Discord
3. Reaffirm my status as the best Lone Druid player on the server
4. Do math homework for me (may require integration with Python/ numpy etc)
5. Fix up the art in illustrator (maybe make more low poly, use more triangles, add gradient)

# Javscript
Currently I'm using Javascript because discord itself is also written in JS, and the JS library 'discord.js' has much greater capabilities (I think) and looks much more epic (I know) than the python one.

It can be found here: <br>
https://discord.js.org/#/

Further documentation and information on how to use the library can be used here: <br>

# Python
Maybe later


# Extra information
- Lonely bot is named after Lone Druid
- Red panda is reference to one of the skins for his bear
- The 'beta' is a reference to Dota, where it's still called dota2beta in the game files
