## Javscript
~~Currently I'm using Javascript because discord itself is also written in JS, and the JS library 'discord.js' has much greater capabilities (I think) and looks much more epic (I know) than the python one.~~

~~It can be found here: <br>
https://discord.js.org/#/~~

~~Further documentation and information on how to use the library can be used here: <br>
https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/general/welcome~~


## Python
Currently using python because it WORKS


# Extra Information <a name="Extra-Information"></a>
- Don't actually have a server, so unless someone is running it, the bot's actually offline; either that or I keep my PC on 24/7
